AquaSense AI is an advanced water quality monitoring platform that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze and predict water safety in real-time. This system empowers communities, environmental agencies, and researchers with actionable insights to ensure water safety and prevent contamination-related health risks.

üåä What AquaSense AI Actually Does
AquaSense AI transforms raw water quality data into intelligent insights through:

Real-time Contaminant Detection

Monitors critical parameters: pH levels, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and chemical contaminants

Detects anomalies and potential hazards in water sources

AI-Predictive Analytics

Forecasts water quality trends using machine learning models

Predicts potential contamination events before they reach critical levels

Comprehensive Visualization

Interactive dashboards showing current water status

Historical trend analysis with customizable timeframes

Geographical mapping of multiple water sources

Automated Alert System

Instant notifications via SMS/email when parameters exceed safe thresholds

Customizable alert levels for different user groups

Water Safety Scoring

Generates easy-to-understand water safety scores (0-100)

Provides actionable recommendations based on current conditions

üìä Sample Data Analysis
python
# Simplified example of water quality prediction model
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(30, 5)),  # 30 timesteps, 5 parameters
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)  # Predict next 5 parameters
])

# Parameters: [pH, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature, Conductivity]
historical_data = load_water_quality_history()
model.fit(historical_data, epochs=100)

# Predict next 24 hours water quality
prediction = model.predict(latest_readings)
